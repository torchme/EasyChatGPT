## Project Title
Chatbot using GPT-4 All

## Project Description
This project is a simple yet powerful chatbot application developed using `streamlit` and the `gpt4all` package. The chatbot leverages the GPT-4 model trained on the "orca-mini-3b.ggmlv3.q4_0" dataset to generate meaningful and intelligent responses to user input.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- streamlit
- gpt4all

You can install them via pip:
```
pip install streamlit gpt4all
```

## How to Run
To run this project, you just need to execute the `main.py` script, which will start a Streamlit server hosting the chatbot interface. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

## Project Structure
- **main.py:** This is the main script of our project. It first sets up a Streamlit application and then initializes our GPT-4 model with the specified dataset. It also takes care of handling user input and producing responses from the chatbot.

## Usage
When you run the script, it will open up a web interface where you can interact with the chatbot. Simply type your question or statement into the provided text box and press enter. The chatbot will then generate a response and display it on the screen.
